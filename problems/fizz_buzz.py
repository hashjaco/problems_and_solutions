"""
Given an integer 'n', for each number up to n, print 'Fizz' if the number is divisible by 5; print 'Buzz' if number is divisible by 3
Print 'FizzBuzz' if the number is divisible by 5 and 3; Print the number if number is not divisible by 5 or 3;

>>> fizz_buzz(3) # begin at 1 and increment while comparing numbers
'1'
'2'
'Buzz'

1 -> 1
2 -> 2
3 -> 'Buzz'

>>> fizz_buzz(15)

1 -> 1
2 -> 2
3 -> 'Buzz'
4 -> 4
5 -> 'Fizz'
6 -> 'Buzz'
7 -> 7
8 -> 8
9 -> 'Buzz'
10 -> 'Fizz'
11 -> 11
12 -> 'Buzz'
13 -> 13
14 -> 14
15 -> 'FizzBuzz'

# Questions
What are the constraints?
within what range of integers can our input be?
Can I make any assumptions about the input?
Should I return anything or just print?

# Edge Cases
>>> fizz_buzz(0)

>>> fizz_buzz(-20)

>>> fizz_buzz("4p50")

>>> fizz_buzz("40")

>>> fizz_buzz()
